You'll have three strikes for most rules, if you DO end up getting 3 strikes, you will be banned. Strikes will individually last depending on the offense, as well as the context. Be careful with your actions in regards to these rules.
Without further ado,
</p>

> Rule 1.) Do not, in a serious manner, harrass other members locally. If you're caught harassing other members non-jokingly, or without strict consent, your strikes will last up to 6 months per, depending on the severity. If it's too severe, you may have less chances rather than 3.

> Rule 2.) Do not post or repost any sort of NSFW content. This includes pornography, gory images, etc. Depending on the severity of the content, the punishment will be decided at that time.

> Rule 3.) Just use common sense and don't be a dick.
