Welcome to TheWired.zone! Our goal is to create a small Anime-based community of which is friendly. Due to the fact that I hand-pick people to join this instance, everybody will be over 18, so you must act like it.
You'll have three strikes for most rules, if you _do_ end up getting 3 strikes, you will be banned. Strikes will individually last up to 3 months depending on the offense, as well as the context. Be careful with your actions in regards to these rules.
Without further ado,

Rule 1.) Do not, in a serious manner, harrass other members. If you're caught harassing other members non-jokingly, your strikes will last up to 6 months per, depending on the severity. If it's too severe, you will only have one other chance rather than 3.

Rule 2.) Do not post any minor-oriented photos (People below the age of 16), NSFW or otherwise. If you do so, and it is NSFW, you will be permabanned on the spot. However, if it is *not* NSFW, you will be only let off with a warning.
