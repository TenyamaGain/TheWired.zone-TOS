You'll have three strikes for most rules, if you _do_ end up getting 3 strikes, you will be banned. Strikes will individually last up to 3 months depending on the offense, as well as the context. Be careful with your actions in regards to these rules.
Without further ado,
</p>

> Rule 1.) Do not, in a serious manner, harrass other members. If you're caught harassing other members non-jokingly, your strikes will last up to 6 months per, depending on the severity. If it's too severe, you will only have one other chance rather than 3.

> Rule 2.) Do not post any minor-oriented photos (People below the age of 16), NSFW or otherwise. If you do so, and it is NSFW, you will be permabanned on the spot. However, if it is *not* NSFW, you will be only let off with a warning. 

> Rule 3.) Make sure all NSFW photos are marked as such. If you are caught with an NSFW photo that isn't marked as such, please delete it and, if you wish, you may reupload it with the NSFW warning.

> Rule 4.) Steer clear of posting any gory imagery, such as beheadings, self harm, etc. Depending on the severity of the image/video, the punishment will be decided at that time.
