You'll have three strikes for most rules, if you DO end up getting 3 strikes, you will be banned. Strikes will individually last depending on the offense, as well as the context. Be careful with your actions in regards to these rules.
Without further ado,
</p>

> Rule 1.) Do not, in a serious manner, harrass other members. If you're caught harassing other members non-jokingly, or without strict consent, your strikes will last up to 6 months per, depending on the severity. If it's too severe, you may have less chances rather than 3.

> Rule 2.) Make sure all NSFW photos are marked as such. If you are caught with an NSFW photo that isn't marked as such, please delete it and, if you wish, you may reupload it with the NSFW warning.

> Rule 3.) Steer clear of posting any gory imagery, such as beheadings, self harm, etc. Depending on the severity of the image/video, the punishment will be decided at that time.

> Rule 4.) Do not "Renote" or post any sort of underage imagery. You will have three strikes if deemed "certainly a loli" or proven underage.  

> Rule 5.) Just use common sense and don't be a dick.
